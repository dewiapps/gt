        <h4>Here's what I think:</h4>
        <p>There is a serious lack of cool web 3.0 tools for musicians.  What does that mean?  Stuff like live data, interactivity, mobile device compatibility, and great looking design.  Why?  Well, probably because music education is not a super lucrative market, or maybe just because most musicians are not stellar programmers.</p>
        <h4>GuitarThinker to the rescue!</h4>
        <p>This site will be a fun place to visit, learn, come back and see what's new.  GuitarThinker will be a place to compete with yourself and others, because competetion motivates us.  This site will have lots of games that are fun to play and teach you music.</p>
